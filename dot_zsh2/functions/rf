# Lets you call `rake features` or `rake features FEATURE=` easily to specify running either one or all of your cucumber tests.
# USAGE: `rf` runs everything
#        `rf features/foo.feature` runs just foo.features
#        `rf features/foo.feature:12` runs the scenario on line 12 of foo.features
# function rf {
  if [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
    rake features
  else
    rake features FEATURE="$1"
  fi
# }
